# Arduino-USB-KM-Swtich
Fully functional KM (Keyboard &amp; Mouse) Switch using Arduino Leonardo Pro Micro and USB shield

This is a fully functional keyboard & mouse switch (KVM but without Video), based on the combination of two Arduino LEONARDO pro Micro and USB host shield.

Keyboard & mouse is toggled with ScrollLock Key. I recommend USB cable keyboard. All Serial communications has baud rate: 115200
