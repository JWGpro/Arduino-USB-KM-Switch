## This project has gliches and is repleaced by newer https://github.com/nathalis/Arduino-USB-KM-Switch-2.0

## ...project status: closed.

This is a keyboard & mouse switch (KVM but without Video), based on the combination of two Arduino LEONARDO pro Micro and USB host shield.

Keyboard & mouse is toggled with ScrollLock Key. I recommend USB cable keyboard. All Serial communications has baud rate: 115200

FOR FULL MOUSE SUPPORT (SCROLL WHEEL) YOU MUST UPDATE LIBRARY BY INCLUDED FIX.
