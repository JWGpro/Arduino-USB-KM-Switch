# Arduino-USB-KM-Switch-1.0

*This is a fork dating from January 2022 of the [original repo by nathalis](https://github.com/nathalis/Arduino-USB-KM-Switch), before it was removed around May 2022.*

## ...project status: closed.

This is a keyboard & mouse switch (KVM but without Video), based on the combination of two Arduino LEONARDO pro Micro and USB host shield.

Keyboard & mouse is toggled with ScrollLock Key. I recommend USB cable keyboard. All Serial communications has baud rate: 115200

FOR FULL MOUSE SUPPORT (SCROLL WHEEL) YOU MUST UPDATE LIBRARY BY INCLUDED FIX.
